## Notes
### Explore the CISSP Security Domains

### 1. Security and Risk Management
Focused on defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and legal regulations.

- By defining security goals and objectives, organizations can reduce risks to critical assets and data like PII, or personally indentifiable information.
- Compliance is the primary method used to develop to an organization's internal security policies, regulatory requirements, and independent standards.

### 2. Assets Security
Focused on securing digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.

- Organization's also need to have policies and procedures that ensures data is properly stored, maintained, retained, and destroyed.
- An organization might have you oversee the destruction of hard drives to male sure that they're properly disposed of. This ensures that private data stored on those drives can't be accessed by threat actors.

### 3. Security Architecture and Engineering 
Focused on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place to protect an organization's assets and data.

### 4. Communication and Network Security
Focused on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications.

- Employees working remotely in public spaces need to be protected from vulnerabilities that can occur when they use insecure bluetooth connections or public wifi hotspots.

### 5. Identify and Access Management
  Focused on access and authorization to keep data secure, by making sure users follow established policies to control and manage assets. (IAM).

- As an entry-level analyst, its essential to keep an organization's systems and data as secure as possible by ensuring user access is limited to what employees need.

 ### There are 4 main components to IAM:
- Identification
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Accountability

 ### 6. Security Assessment and Testing
 Focused on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.

- Security controls testing can help on organization identify new and better ways to mitigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
- Analyst might use security control testing evaluates and security assessment reports to improve existing controls or implement nmew controls.

### 7. Security Operations
Focused on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.

- A there is a active attack, mitigating the attack and preventing it from escalating further is essential for ensuring that private information is protected from threat actors.
- A digital forensics investigation must take place to identify when, how, and why the breach occurred. This helps secrutiy teams determine areas for improvement and preventative measures that can be taken to mitigate future attacks.

### 8. Software Development Security
Focused on using secure coding practices.

- Secure coding practices ar recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services.
- Performing a ecure design review during the design phase, secure code reviews during the development and testing phase, and penetration testing during the deployment and implementing phase ensures that security is embedded into the software product at every step.
- Being familiar with these domains can help you better understand how they're used to improve the overall security of an organization and the critical role security teams play.
- As an analyst, you can explore various areas of cybersecurity that interest me. You will learn more about CISSP's eight security domains aand how they relate to the walk I'll do as a security analyst.

## Threats, risks, vulnerabilities
- As an entry-level security analyst, one of your many roles will be to handle an organization's digital and physical assets.
- Organizations tend to rate risks at different levels: low, medium, high depending on possible threats and the value of an aseet.
- Low-risk asset - Information that would not harm the organization's reputation or ongoing operations, and would not financial damage if compromised.
- Examples would be public information such as website content or published research data.
- Medium-risk asset - Information that's not available to the public and may cause some damage to the organzation's finances, reputation, or ongoing operations.
- For example, the early release of a company's quarterly earnings could impact the value of their stock.
- High-risk asset - Information protected by regulations or laws, which if compromised would have servere negative impact on an organization's finances, ongoing operations, or reputation.
- This could include leaked assets with SPI, PII, or intellectual property.
- Once ransomware is deployed by an attacker, it can freeze networks systems, leave devices unusable, and encrypt, or lock confidential data, making devices inaccessible.
- When ransomware negotiations occur or data is leaked by threat actors, these events can occur through the dark web.
- The web is actually an interlinked network of online content that's made up of three layers: the surface web, the deep web, and the dark web.
- The surface web is the layer that most people use, contains content that can be accessed using a web browser.
- The deep web generally requires authorization to access. An organization's intranet is an example of the deep web, since in can only be accessed by employees or others who can have been granted access.
- The dark web can only be access by using special software. The dark web generally carriers a negative connotation since it is the preferred web layer for criminals because of the secrecy that it provides.
  
## NIST's Risk Management Framework
- Having a solid foundational understanding of how to mitigate and manage risk can set me apart from other candidates as I begin your job search in the field of security.

## There are seven steps in the RMF:
- Prepare
- Categorize
- Select
- Implement
- Assess
- Authorize
- Monitor

## RMF Step 1: Prepare
Activities that are necessary to manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs.

- As an entry-level analyst, I'll likely use this step to monitor for risks and identify controls that can be used to reduce those risks.

## RMF Step 2: Categorize
Used to develope risk management processes and tasks.

- As an entry-level analyst, you'll need to be able to understand how to follow the processes established by your organization to reduce risks to critical assets, such as private customer information.

## RMF Step 3: Select
Choose, customize, and capture documentation of the controls that protect an organzaition.

- An example of the select step would be keeping a playbook up-to-date or helping to manage other documentation that allows you and your team to address issues more efficiently.

## RMF Step 4: Implement
Implementing security and privacy plans for the organization.

- For example, if you notice a pattern of employees constantly needing password resets, implementing a change to password requirements may help solve this issue.

## RMF Step 5: Assess
Determine if established controls are implemented correectly.

- It's essential to take the time to analyze whether the implemented protocols, procedures, and controls that are in place are meeting organizational needs.
- During this step, analyst identify potential weaknesses and determine whether the organization's tools, procedures, controls, and protocols should be changed to better manage potential risks.

## RMF Step 6: Authorize
Being accountable for the security and privacy risks that many exist in ann organization.

- As analyst, the authorization step could involve generating reports, developing plans of action, and establishing project milestones that are aligned to your  organizations goals.

## RMF Step 7: Monitor
Be aware of how systems are operating.
