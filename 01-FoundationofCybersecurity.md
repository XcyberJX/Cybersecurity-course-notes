# Notes
- In 1986, the Alvi brothers created the Brain virus. It was used to track illegal copies of medical software and prevent pirated licenses.
- In 1988, Robert Morris developed a program to assess the siza of the internet. 6,000 computers were affected, reprsenting 10% of the internet at the time.
- In the year 2000, Onel De Guzmen created the LoveLetter malware to steal internet login credentials.
- The LoveLetter ended up infecting 45 million computers globally and is believed to have caused over $10 billion dollars in damages.
- One way to safegaurd an organization is to conduct regular internal trainings.
- In 2017, attackers successfully infiltrated the credit report agency, Equifax. One of the largest known data breaches of sensitive information. Over 143 million customer records were stolen, and the breach affected approximately 40% of all americans.

## Common Phishing Attacks Used Today:
- **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**
- **Spear Phishing**
- **Whaling**
- **Vishing**
- **Smishing**

- There are four core Components of Frameworks

## Purpose of Security Frameworks:

- Protecting PII
- Securing financial information
- Identifying security weaknesses
- Managing organizational risks
- Aligning security with business goals

---

## Components of Frameworks:

### 1. Identifying and Documenting Security Frameworks

- An organization may have a goal to align with the E.U.'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- GDPR is a data protection law established to grant European citizens more control over their personal data.
- May be asked to identify and document areas where an organization is out of compliance with GDPR.

---

### 2. Setting Guidelines to Achieve Security Goals

- Your organization may need to develope new policies for how to handle data requests from individual users.

---

### 3. Implementing Strong Security Processes

- When a user attempts to update or delet their profile information.

---

### 4. Monitoring and Communicating Results

- You may monitor your organizations internal network and report a potential security issues affecting GDPR to your manager or regulatory compliance officer.

---

# Notes

- Frameworks allow analyst to work alongside other members of the security team to document, implement, and use the policies and procedures that have been created.
- Your company might have a guideline that requires all employees to complete privacy training to reduce the risk of data breaches.
- Security professionals can use a form of data protection like encryption to safeguard data from being tampered with.
- An application that stores sensitive data, such as social security numbers or bank accounts, is a valuable asset to an organization.
- NIST stands for National Institution of Standards and Technology which is based in the U.S.
- Security teams use CSF as a baseline to manage short and long-term risk.
- The most dangerous threat actors to consider are disgruntled employees. They often have access to sensitive information and know where to fine it.
- You may be asked in an interview if you know about security frameworks and principles. You may have be asked to explain how they're used to secure organizational assets.
- The **Federal Energy Regulatory Commission - North American ELectricity Reliability Corporation (FERC-NERC)** - a regulation that applies to organizations that work with electricity or that are involved with the U.S. and North American power grid. Are legally required to adhere to the Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Reliability Standards defined by FERC.

## Ethical Principles in Security

- Confidentiality
- Privacy Protection
- Laws

---

# Notes

- Privacy protection means safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use.
- Laws are rules that are recognized by a community and enforced by a govering entity.
- Technology is constantly evolving and so are attackers!
- **Vigilante** - A person who is not a memeber of law enforcement who decides to stop a crime on their own.

## The International Court of Justice (ICJ) states that a person or group can counterattack:

- The counterattack will only affect the party that attacked first.
- The counterattack is a direct communication asking the initial attacker to stop.
- The counterattack does not escalate the situation.

## In order to have an ethical obligation to protect your organization you must:

- You must remain unbiased and conduct your work honestly, responsibly, and with the highest respect for the law
- Be transparent and rely on evidence.
- Ensure that you are consistently invested in the work you are doing, so you can ethically address the issues that arise.
- Stay informed and strive to advance your skills, so you can contribute to the betterment of the cyber landscape.

- SIEM tools collect real-time, or instant, information, and allow security analysts to identify potential breaches as they happen.
- SIEM tools reduce the amount of data an analyst must review.
- Commonnly used SIEM tools: Splunk and Chronicle.
- Splunk is a data analyst platform.
- Splunk Enterprise is a self-hosted  tool used to retain, analyse, and search an organization's log data.
- **Chronicle** is a cloud-native SIEM tool that stores security data for search and analysis.
- As a security analyst, you may find yourself using SIEM tools to analyze filtered events and patterns, perform incident analysis, or proactively search for threats.
- **Playbook** - a manual that provides details about any operational action.
- Playbooks can pertain to  security or compliance reviews, access management, and many other organizational tasks that require a documented process from beginning to end.
- Commmon  network protocol analyzers include **tcpdump** and **Wireshark**.
- **Chain of Custody** - The process of documenting evidence possession and controling during an incident lifecycle.
- As a security analyst, involved in a forensic analysis, you will work with the computer data that was breached.
- The evidence is your responsibility while it is in your possession. Evidence must be kept safe and tracked. Everytime evidence is moved it should be reported.

## Introduction of Linux, SQL, and Python
### Notes

- Linux relies on a command line as primary user interface.
- A common use of Linux for entry-level security analysts is examining logs to better understand what's occurring in a system.
- An entry-level security analyst would use SQL to filter through the data points to retrieve specific information.
- **Python** - Used to perform tasks that are repetitive and time-consuming, and that require a high level of detail and accurracy.
- Become familiar with standard tools to show employers that you have the ability to learn how to use their tools protect the organization and the pepole it servers.
