# Foundation of Cybersecurity
## Welcome to the exciting world of cybersecurity! (Module 1)
Terms:
- **Cybersecurity** - the practice of ensuring confidentially, integrity, and availability of information.
- **Cloud Security** - the process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured and access to those assets is limited to authorized users.
- **Internal Threat** - a current or former employee, external vendor, or trusted partnre who poses a security risk.
- **Network Security** - the practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access.
- **Personally Identifiable Information** - any information used to infer an individual's identity.
- **Security Posture** - an organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change.
- **Sensitive Personally Identifiable** - a specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling.
- **Technical Skills** - skills that require knowledge of specific tools, procedures, policies.
- **Threat** - Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.
- **Threat Actor** - any person or group who presents a security risk.
- **Transferable Skills** - skills from other areas that can apply to different cases.

# Notes
- An external threat is someone outside of the organization trying to gain access to private information, network, or devices.
- Most security work is learned on the job depending on the group or organization you are protecting.
- Security analyst are responsible for monitoring and protecting information and systems, installing prevention software, and conducting periodic security audits.
- A security audit is a review of an organizations security records, activities, or other related documents.
- The Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate helps you prepare for the CompTIA Security+ exam!

# The evolution of cybersecurity (Module 2)
Terms:
- **Adversarial Artificial Intelligence (AI)** - a technique that manipulates artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technology to conduct attacks more efficiently
- **Business Email Compromise (BEC)** - a type of phishing attack where a threat actor impersonates a known source to obtain financial advantage.
- **CISSP** - Certified Information System Security Professional is a globally recognized and highly sought-after information security certification, awarded by the International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium.
- **Computer Virus** - malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software.
- **Cryptographic Attack** - an attack that affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient.
- **Hacker** - any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data.
- **Malware** - software designed to harm devices or networks.
- **Password Attack** - an attempt to access to computer systems, networks, or data.
- **Phishing** - the use of digital communication s to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.
- **Physical Attack** - a security incident that affects not only digital but also physical environments where the incident is deployed.
- **Physical Social Engineering** - an attack in which a theat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.
- **Social Engineering** - a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.
- **Social Media Phishing** - a type of attack targeting threat actor collects detailed information about their target on social media sites before initiating the attack.
- **Spear phishing** - a malicious email attack targeting a specific user or group of users, appearing to originate from a trusted source.
- **Supply-Chain Attack** - an attack that targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed.
- **USB Baiting** - an attack in which a threat actor strategically leaves a  malware USB stick for an employee to find and install to unknowingly infect a network.
- **Virus** - refer to "computer virus".
- **Vishing** - the exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.
- **Watering Hole Attack** - a type of attack when a threat actor compromises a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.

# Notes
- In 1986, the Alvi brothers created the Brain virus. It was used to track illegal copies of medical software and prevent pirated licenses.
- In 1988, Robert Morris developed a program to assess the siza of the internet. 6,000 computers were affected, reprsenting 10% of the internet at the time.
- In the year 2000, Onel De Guzmen created the LoveLetter malware to steal internet login credentials.
- The LoveLetter ended up infecting 45 million computers globally and is believed to have caused over $10 billion dollars in damages.
- One way to safegaurd an organization is to conduct regular internal trainings.
- In 2017, attackers successfully infiltrated the credit report agency, Equifax. One of the largest known data breaches of sensitive information. Over 143 million customer records were stolen, and the breach affected approximately 40% of all americans.

## Common Phishing Attacks Used Today:
- **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**
- **Spear Phishing**
- **Whaling**
- **Vishing**
- **Smishing**

## Common Malware Attacks Today:
- **Virus**
- **Worms**
- **Ransomware**
- **Spyware**
- **Social Engineering**

## Common Social Engineering Attacks Today:
- **Social Media Phishing**
- **Water Hole Attack**
- **USB Baiting**
- **Physical Social Engineering**

## Social Engineering Principals:
Reasons why social engineering attacks are effective include:

- Authority: threat actors impersonate individuals with power.
- Intimidation: threat actors use bully tactics.
- Consensus/Social proof: People sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing , threat actors use trust to pretend they are legitimate.
- Scarcity: a tactic used to imply that goods and services are in limited supply.
- Familiarity: threat actors establish a fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.
- Trust: threat actors establish an emotional relationship with users that can be exploited over time.
- Urgency: a threat actor persuades other to respond quickly and without question.

## The 8 CISSP Security Domains:
- Security and Risk Management
- Asset Security
- Security Architecture and Engineering
- Communications and Network Security
- Identity and Access Management
- Security Assessment and Testing
- Security Operations
- Software Development Security

## 1. Security and Risk Management:
Defines security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law.

- A security analyst may need to update company policies related to private health information if a change is made to a federal compliance regulation as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

## 2. Asset security:
Secures digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.

- Security analyst may be tasked with making sure that old equipment is properly disposed of and destroyed.

## 3. Security Architecture and Engineering:
Optimizes data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place.

- May be tasked with configuring a firewall. A **firewall** is a device used to monitor and filter incoming and outgoing computer network traffic. Setting up a firewall correctly helps prevent attacks that could affect productivity.
